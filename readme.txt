This repository contains our code accompanying the ACM TIST paper 
"Adversarial Missingness Attacks on Causal Structure Learning". It is organized 
into two subfolders:
i. chain_tree_sachs and 
ii. erdosrenyi

The first folder, "chain_tree_sachs", is used for the experiments involving:
-linear SCMs with Gaussian noise,
-chain graphs, binary tree graphs, Sachs dataset.

The second folder, "erdosrenyi", is used for the experiments involving:
-linear SCMs with Gaussian, Laplace, and Gumbel noise,
-non-linear SCMs with Gaussian noise,
-Erdos-Renyi graphs.

Please see the experiment specific directions provided in the readme.txt files 
of the respective subfolders.
